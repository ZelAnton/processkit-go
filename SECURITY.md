# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest released version of **processkit-go**.
Older versions are not maintained — upgrade to the latest release to receive
fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ZelAnton/processkit-go/security/advisories/new)
(repository **Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability**). If that is
unavailable, contact the maintainer listed on the
[ZelAnton](https://github.com/ZelAnton) profile.

Please include:

- a description of the vulnerability and its impact;
- steps to reproduce (a minimal proof of concept is ideal);
- affected version(s).

You can expect an initial acknowledgement within a few days. Once a fix is
ready, a patched release is published as a new `vX.Y.Z` tag (which pkg.go.dev and
the module proxy pick up) and the advisory is disclosed.

## Automated scanning

This project ships three layers of scanning:

- **CodeQL** ([`codeql.yml`](.github/workflows/codeql.yml)) runs GitHub's
  static analysis over the Go code on every push, pull request, and weekly.
- **govulncheck** (a CI job in [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) checks the
  dependency tree against the [Go vulnerability database](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/),
  reporting only vulnerabilities reachable from your code.
- **Dependabot** ([`dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml)) keeps GitHub
  Actions and Go module dependencies current.
